#Test case: inference using pickled features

Run `python predict.py ../../download_af2_parameters/params_model_3.pth`    

This will produce `prediction.pdb` which should be identical to `expected_prediction.pdb`

##Files
- `features.pkl`: Features produced by AlphaFold 2 from `1a0b.cif`
- `expected_prediction.pdb`: expected predicted structure.
